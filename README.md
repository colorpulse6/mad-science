# Mad Science

## Description
Mad Science is a game where the player must click on the appropriate balls falling from the screen to fill his beakers with ingredients. Each beaker will hold 3 ingredients. If the player fills 4 beakers he will advance to the next level.  The player starts with 10 lives and will loose a life if a target ball falls to the floor before he is able to catch it. He will also gain a life as well as score points if he clicks on a target ball.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- Balls falling from the top of screen
- Points scored on click of target color
- 3 colors per beaker
- Game screen reload on target change
- 4 full beakers to win the game
- 10 lives/player looses 1 life per target ball that hits the ground

## Backlog

- Update DOM for new level
- Increase difficulty
- Advance level
- Generate random sizes for balls
